# monitor-pr

Monitor a pull request until CI finishes and Copilot's code review arrives — without polling. Launches two async terminals that watch the PR in the background; the agent is notified automatically when either one produces a verdict.

| [monitor-pr](skills/monitor-pr/) | Start two async monitor terminals (CI + Copilot review) and react to their results |

## How It Works

1. **Identify the PR** — from conversation context, or a PR number the user provides.
2. **Launch two async terminals** — one runs `wait-for-ci.mts`, the other `wait-for-copilot-review.mts`. Both exit with a single `RESULT: <STATE>` line.
3. **React to the verdict** — on `CI_FAILED`, investigate whether the failure is real or a known-flake pattern; on `NEW_COPILOT_REVIEW` or `UNRESOLVED_COPILOT_REVIEW_COMMENTS`, fix the code and decide whether to push.
4. **Restart after pushing** — new commits invalidate in-flight runs, so monitors are re-launched after each push.

## Requirements

- `gh` CLI installed and authenticated
- Node.js (scripts use only built-in modules — no install step)
